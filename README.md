Step 1: The attacker sends you an email that looks like it’s from Naukri.com, with logo, layout, and fake job offers.

Step 2: Inside the email, there’s a “View Job Details” or “Login to Apply” or “Register Now” button.

Step 3: This link takes you to a fake login page that looks exactly like Naukri.com.

Step 4: If you enter your credentials, they go straight to the attacker instead of the real website.

(Though you will end up to the real Naukri.com website, your credentials have already reached the attacker.)


I built a phishing simulation page for Naukri.com as part of my ethical hacking studies.

Purpose: To demonstrate how easily someone can copy the look of a legitimate site.

Technology Used: HTML, CSS, and Flask (Python) for form handling.

How It Works in My Demo: If someone logs in on my fake page, the credentials are stored locally if the target logs in or registers on naukri.com. And the target will eventually reach the real naukri.com page and surf as usual, but the credentials are what I wanted, and I got that.

In today's world, where every person is trying to find jobs or recruit someone, getting fake emails for jobs is a common way of attack used by attackers. If the target gets trapped and loses its credentials to the attacker, the attacker can use their email to get access to all other platforms the target uses and could harm them financially or emotionally because all of the private and personal information will be with the attacker, and they can do anything they want.
